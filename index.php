It is a critical juncture that calls you to action. What a couple does afterwards often determines whether the relationship will become stronger than it's ever been or signify the demise of the relationship. Our Crisis ICC Program has an impressive success rate with couples recovering from betrayals.</p>                    <a class="healing" href="healing.php">Start Healing Now</a>                </div>                <div class="col span_1_of_2 midboxes">                    <a class="noline" href="brink.php"><img src="inc/images/On_the_Brink.png" alt="ON THE BRINK" class="aligncenter size-full" data-recalc-dims="1" />                        <h4 class="font_blackred">ON THE BRINK</h4>                    </a>                    <p>Over 60% of couples seriously consider separation or divorce.

Some couples need help in communicating better – they are either fighting all the time, or worse yet – not fighting at all. Others need help in rekindling the spark. Our Intimacy ICC therapists can help you communicate and connect.</p>                    <a class="healing seeking" href="seeking.php">Start Connecting Now</a>                </div>                <div class="col span_1_of_2 midboxes">                    <a class="noline" href="wanting.php"><img src="inc/images/Wanting_Results_Now.png" alt="WANTING RESULTS NOW" class="aligncenter size-full" data-recalc-dims="1" />                        <h4 class="font_green">WANTING RESULTS NOW</h4>                    </a>                    <p>Some couples are busy and just don't have the time to come to regular weekly therapy, and yet they are motivated to grow and improve their relationship.
