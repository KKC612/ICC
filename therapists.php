                                    <p>Nancy is our Resident Wise Soul (RWS). From the first time we met Nancy we knew our couples struggling the most would find hope with Nancy. Nancy is especially skilled in helping couples encountering complex grief and situations which seem profoundly hopeless.</p>
                                    <p>Her soft and warm presence provide an environment for clients to explore their needs and process their pain. We are very fortunate to have her.</p>

                                    <p>Terry is known as the most empathic member of our therapists. Terry is not only caring – but she is a competent therapist who loves working with couples and families (and individuals of course!). Terry is very popular among the clients at RTC due to her gift in transforming difficult situations into opportunities for intimacy.</p>
                                    <p>She has intensive training in Terry Real’s Relational Life Therapy, as well as the Gottman Method.

There is a constant line outside of Brie’s office composed of therapists, clients, small children, and who knows what else – all seeking her sage advice. Brie will persevere with you to find the answers you are looking for (just try to get her to give up – we dare you).</p>
                                    <p>Her clients report that she is tenacious in helping them find happiness in their lives and relationships. She is our Most Precious Natural Resource (MPNR). We love that she wears her heart on her sleeve. Love it.</p>

                                    <p>Kyle is strongly pro-marriage and he challenges his clients to move beyond their normal limits so they can regain the connection they have lost, work through a betrayal, and/or have better sex then ever before. He is a certified sex therapist and enjoys working with all kinds of relationships. He is LGBT, Poly, alt and kink friendly.</p>
